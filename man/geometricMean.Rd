\title{Calculate the Geometric Mean}
\usage{
geometricMean(x, warn = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector. Zeros and NaN removed before the calculation of
the mean and the warnings are handled according to the \code{warn}
parameter.}

\item{warn}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), warnings are issued when zeros
or NaN values are encountered and removed. If \code{FALSE}, removal occurs
silently.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar representing the geometric mean of \code{x} (after
removal of zeros and NaN values). Returns \code{NA} if any \code{NA} values
are present in the input.
}
\description{
Computes the geometric mean of a numeric vector. The geometric mean is the
nth root of the product of n numbers, useful for data representing rates of
change or ratios.
}
\details{
The function implements the following data cleaning steps:
\itemize{
\item Zeros are removed before calculation (they would bias the result toward 0)
\item NaN values are removed
\item If any \code{NA} values are present, \code{NA} is returned immediately
}

The geometric mean is calculated as: \eqn{GM = (x_1 \times x_2 \times ... \times x_n)^{1/n}}
}
\examples{
geometricMean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
geometricMean(c(2, 8))  # Should return 4
geometricMean(c(1, 0, 5), warn = FALSE)  # Silently removes zero
